## Remove RIM, HEADLIGHT (P/N 33101-K2E-T01) and HEADLIGHT UNIT (P/N 33110-K0F-T02)
1. This is part of the USB install but also used for the OPMID install. In the USB install video, the installer almost drops the headlight unit. Because of this, I taped it with some painter's tape first on the upper surface just in case, so if it did pop free it would just dangle from the tape.
2. Unscrew 2x screws on the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions on the headlight. (P/N 91509-GE2-760) - JIS screwdriver
3. Release the headlight unit and unclip the plug at the back.

The regular USB mounts are slightly wider than the japanese Kitaco kits, so will require widening the Honda mount.

I ended up using a manual rasp because I only have a sanding wheel, and that sanding wheel attachment was going to die really fast on the soft aluminum mount. So I rasped it down most of the way, and then used the sanding wheel to clean it up to a nice finished surface. Of course, I still scratched up the aluminum mount in the process for the 10s I was using the dremel tool didn't I?
- Positap the black and yellow cable to the main headlight to your positive USB
- Positap the green cable to one of the blinkers to your negative USB.

Run the cables out the back with the rest of the wires and connect the spade connectors to the USB plug. Before reassembling everything completely turn the bike on and verify there is power.
