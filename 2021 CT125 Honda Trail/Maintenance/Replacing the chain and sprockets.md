## Replacing the chain
There are two ways to do this. The more mainstream method is to remove the left crank case rear cover (see [[#^20ac45|replacing the front sprocket]] below for instructions on that) to expose the chain at the front sprocket, then to remove the chain completely, use that to calculate where to break the new chain, then feeding it through manually. This method is more reliable.

The second method is to use the first chain to feed the second chain through, cut it to length, and then secure it with a master link. This either requires counting the number of links, knowing the length of the chain ahead of time, or very accurately calculating which of the links needs to be broken. If you already have a length of chain to compare to or know the exact length of chain to cut, this method is faster.

1. Take a photo of the old master link orientation. This is mostly for peace of mind later to know you installed it the same way.
2. Mark the old chain next to the master link such that you can install it in the same front-back, same up-down as it was originally. I usually clean the link a little, add a mark on it, and take a photo.
3. Remove the master link from the old chain. Usually achieved with a set of pliers to remove the master link clip. Can also be done with a chain breaker if frustrated enough or using the Motion Pro Master Link Press tool.
4. Remove the old chain.
5. Lay it out alongside the new chain. Note that due to chain stretch, the rollers won't match up exactly, so adjust the chain to find out where the old chain ends against the new chain.
6. Mark off which pin you're going to remove. Measure twice, cut once.
7. Cut the old link off. You can dremel the head first to make it easier, but when snug my tool seems to handle it just fine.
8. Feed the new chain through.
9. Push the master link in from behind (right side of bike) so the two pronged parts face you.
	- On an O-ring or X-ring chain, this step will require greasing the rings on the far-side first. They'll go on in order as plate-ring-rollers for the chains.
10. Press on the outer plate for master link. The pressure needs to be applied evenly on the plate over the left and right pins, to expose the groove the master link clip sits in (can be tested by sliding the edge of the master link clip against the outer plate and checking if it can sit inside the groove). This task should not be done with vice grips, but can be done with vice grips. If there's one reason to buy the Master Link Press Tool, it's this moment right here.
	- On an O-ring or X-Ring chain, the greased rings will need to be placed over the pins before this step.

> [!warning] The master link clip should slide into the groove easily, and should not be pried on or levered on.

11. Install the master link clip. The round end should face the direction the chain is traveling when the rear wheel is rotating. The clip is pretty fragile so don't force it if it won't fit. See photos for references.
12. Take a photo for peace of mind later.

## Replacing the rear sprocket
### Remove the rear wheel
Being able to support the weight of the rear wheel will make this step easier when removing the rear axle. Additionally, it will make it easier when reinstalling the rear wheel and sliding the rear axle through to engage the hub, the hub collar and the brake sub assembly.

1. Using a 19mm on the nut side and the 14mm to hold the nut side, loosen the 19mm nut off the right side of the axle.
2. Using a 12mm and 10mm wrench (12mm closer to the axle), loosen the 10mm nut off the end to release the lock
3. Loosen the 12mm nut evenly on both sides to add slack to the chain. I use 1/6 turns (flat to flat) to turn it evenly on both sides.
4. Once adequately loose, remove the rear axle by removing the nut to the left. Visually order from left to right is:
| Position | Part | Part number | 
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| 1 | AXLE, FR. WHEEL (FOR RR.) | 44301-K01-900 |
| 2 | WASHER, RR. AXLE | 90501-K0G-900 |
| 3 | PLATE, SWINGARM SIDE | 90559-K0G-900|
| 4 | Swingarm (is not removed) | |
| 5 | ADJUSTER, CHAIN (inside swingarm, has prong on underside) | 40543-K0G-900 |
| 6 | Rear wheel | |
| 7 | BRACKET SUB-ASSY., RR. (Rear brake sub assembly) | 43190-K2E-T01 |
| 8 | COLLAR, R. RR. WHEEL SIDE | 42313-KTM-750 |
| 9 | Swingarm (is not removed) | | 
| 10 | ADJUSTER, CHAIN (inside swingarm, has prong on underside) | 40543-K0G-900 |
| 11 | PLATE, SWINGARM SIDE | 90559-K0G-900	|
| 12 | WASHER, RR. AXLE | 90501-K0G-900 |
| 13 | NUT, U (12MM) | 90306-K0G-901 |

### Remove and replace the rear sprocket
1. 4 nuts holding the rear sprocket on. The nuts have a small cut-in on the outside of them that locks them in place firmly, note that they face outwards on replacing the sprocket.

| Part | Part number |
| ---- | ----| 
| NUT, U (8MM) (FUJI SEIMITSU) | 90309-KPH-971 |

### Reinstall the rear wheel
1. Note that the collar and brake sub assembly need to align nicely into the grooves on the hub and the inside of the swingarm.
2. Note the chain adjuster has directionality via a prong on the underside.
3. Note that the brake pads may not easily slide over the brake rotor. Be patient and align everything well and it will fit without any special tools.

## Replacing the front sprocket
^20ac45
### Remove the left crank case rear cover
1. Two bolts, upper and lower. It feels like you might need to remove additional hardware to get at it, you don't, just flex the case around it. There's two bolts, one upper that's a little deeper, one lower.
	1. If you do remove the additional hardware, it's 3-14 Left Pivot Plate for the torque specs.
2. Use an 8mm socket to remove these.

| BOLT, FLANGE (6X25) | 96001-06025-00 |

### Remove the fixing plate bolts
1. Securing the rear wheel, undo the two bolts that attach the fixing plate to the countersprocket. These were quite tight on my bike and had very little clearance from the countershaft. After this step, the sprocket will still be attached to the countershaft, but can be slid off by hand.

> [!warning]- Do not use an impact driver
> This is still connected to the transmission at this point. While it might seem like a good idea, there's chance of damaging the tranmission with an impact driver here. Use as a last resort only.

> [!todo] See if the T-handle from motion pro will work better here when the replacement bolts come in.

| Part | Part number |
| ---- | ----| 
| BOLT, HEX. (6X10) | 92101-06010-0A |
| PLATE, FIXING | 23802-GN5-910 |

### Remove the fixing plate and sprocket
1. Rotate the fixing plate to slide it off the groove that holds it in place. Once that's out of the way, slide the front sprocket off the countershaft.

| Part | Part number |
| ---- | ----| 
| SPROCKET, DRIVE (14T) | 23801-K2E-T00 |
| SPROCKET, DRIVE (13T) | JTF 273.13 |

### Replace the spocket and install in reverse order.
1. Not much to note other than some blue loctite was applied in one user's video.


## Chain adjustment and alignment

^a52642
1. Once the chain is on, adjust the tension. The rear axle nuts (14mm, 19mm) should be snug but loose for this adjustment.
2. The spec is written on the swingarm but is 30mm of movement. The [[CT125 Manual References/2021_Honda_Trail_Manual.pdf#page=71|owner's manual on pg 67]] has a good reference. Looser is better than tighter. Using both the 12mm and the 10mm wrenches at the same time, loosen the lock nut (10mm) on the end of the swingarms and adjust the 12mm nut until the chain tension is correct.
3. Taking the straight edge ruler, measure along the top of the markings from the swingarm side plate (silver) to the end of the red swingarm where the chain adjuster end cap (silver) starts. These should be within 0.5mm on both sides. If not, adjust and check chain tension.
4. Once they're within 0.5mm, line up the ruler along the sprocket to visually verify the chain alignment is correct (or use Motion Pro Chain Alignment Tool).
5. Holding the 12mm nut in place, tighten the 10mm lock nut against it.
6. Once the chain adjustment nuts are tight, tighten the rear axle nuts.

## Post servicing additional actions
1. Because the rear wheel was removed, sometimes the rear brake caliper may have opened up the pads a little. Before riding, press the rear brake lever a few times before riding to ensure it feels solid and contacts the braking surface.
2. Go for a short ride and check the master link is still on the bike and no additional adjustments need to be made.
