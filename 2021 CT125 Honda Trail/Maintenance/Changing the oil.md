Pretty standard procedure.

Honda GN4 is recommended in the owner's manual. 0.7L when doing regular changes, 1L when disassembling it. This approximately corresponds to 650g of oil.

It's the only 17mm bolt that faces directly down on the motorcycle. If you use the MP-01 plug it will stick to the skidpan.

**Other things that are good ideas:**
- Put cardboard down under the bike before doing it.
- Reset the OPMID oil trip meter by selecting the Oil mileage by pressing A repeatedly and holding it until it clears.
