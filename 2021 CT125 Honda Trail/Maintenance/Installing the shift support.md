## Generic approach
The generalized approach for this task is to remove the shifter, slide the support over the shift shaft, bolt it to the crank case and then reinstall the shifter.

> [!warning] 
> My first attempt to do this did not use a 6 point socket for the 12mm bolts. This resulted in rounding off the bolt head on the first attempt. I highly recommend using the 12mm 6 point socket for this job.

1. Using the 12mm 6 point socket, remove the 4 bolts holding the step bar. I ended up having to remove two additional bolts holding the [Left and Right Pipe Covers](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/2021-honda-trail-125-abs/main-pipe-cover?submodel=ct125aac) ("engine guards") as well to drop the assembly also using the 12mm socket. This was VERY tight on my bike.
2. Using the 10mm socket and the socket extender, remove the hex bolt securing the shift lever to the splined gearshift spindle. 
3. With the shift lever off, remove two of the crank case cover bolts below the shift spindle using the 8mm socket and socket extender.
4. Install the shift support over the shift spindle. This may requires sandpapering the inner bearing. Do this by hand for the best result - wrapping a screwdriver with sandpaper did the trick. Took maybe 3-4 minutes with some 100 grit, stopping every 20-30s to see if it would slide over the lip. You want it to be as tight a fit as is possible while still being able to slide it over.
5. Install the two new crank case cover bolts along with the offsets. There are two metal offsets supplied with the shift support that go between the crank case cover and the shift support. Everything lined up nicely on mine. Have the 8mm socket and extension handy to finish screwing it in. Torque it to 12 Nm.
6. Reinstall the shift lever. It's a 10mm socket with the extension, but it's a 6mm flange bolt, so 12 Nm.
7. Reinstall the 4 bolts on the underside of the step assembly. These are 8mm flange bolts using a 12mm 6 point socket, torqued to 27 Nm.

[^1]: 8mm for the crank case flange bolts. 10mm for the shift flange bolt. 12mm for the bolts holding the step assembly on.
[^2]: May not be required on all models. Some models have a stepped spline for the shift shaft, and requires sanding of the shift support sleeve.
