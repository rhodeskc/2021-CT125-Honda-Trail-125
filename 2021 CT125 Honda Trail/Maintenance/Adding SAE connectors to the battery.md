# Adding SAE connectors to the battery

> [!warning] This section is incomplete.

The purpose of this is generally to add battery tenders connectors, however choosing the right SAE connectors will allow the battery to be connected to the overall charging system, with the battery itself stabilizing any fluctuation in the stator output.

SAE cable install
I just could not get the right screws to do the battery work needed, so settled for a single SAE battery tender cable running backwards and reused the original screws. Due to the heat, I decided to run the quicker option of up under the seat instead of underneath the air box, which allows me to easily remove it if I don't like it for any reason.

1. JIS screwdriver for the battery terminals.
2. Redid the ring wire connectors to the correct size using my wire strippers, then installed it.

Because the fuel tank itself is exposed, there's no real way to hide the cable coming up from the battery to where the seat is. The best you can do is run it up the back and underside, which required a lot more work than I was willing to do in the moment. With a longer cable than the one I had it might be possible to follow the airbox up and pop it out near the snorkel which would be my second choice.

A single push pin on the front left of the gas tank area needed to be popped to work the cable under the body panel. The SAE fuse box sits in a little gap that's not quite big enough for sliding it in discretely; if you elect not to use a fused connection you will trade this problem for a different kind of problem. This is a less than ideal install location, but is easy to iterate on later.

Later I removed the battery cover (make it easier to pop the snorkel cover without snapping tabs) and then removed the snorkel cover. Fed it along there and popped it out right behind the snorkel.
