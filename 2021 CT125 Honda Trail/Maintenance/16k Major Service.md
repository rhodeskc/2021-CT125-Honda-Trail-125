## Spinner cleanout steps
### Disconnect the sidestand switch

**This is not a plug. You have to unscrew it. It looks like a plug but it is not. For the love of god, don't try to pull it out.**

- Philips head screwdriver.

### Remove the kickstart

**12mm socket**
- You'll need to remove it anyway and doing it now will give you more access to all the other bits.

### Remove the bash plate

*5mm Hex key; low clearance driver if using my electric screwdriver.*
- 4 bolts on the underside.

### Remove right engine guard, loosen left (remove step bar)

*12mm sockets, no torque spec*

- There's 6 underside bolts. The 2 outermost ones without washers hold the engine guards on the bike. 
- Remove the outer ones. While you're down there might as well undo the 4x step mount bolts as well (same 12mm socket)
- This drops down the step platform.
- The right engine guard should release easily. Looking inside you'll see the left one is bolted in.
- Swing the left one down and away from the step bar so you can feed it through and remove it.

### Remove the exhaust (a good idea but not strictly necessary)

- *17mm open ended wrench,12mm socket for all bolts, 27 Nm torque spec*
- *1x Philips screwdriver, 5mm Hex key*

- Lower bolt
	- To access this, you'll need to remove the panel covering the rear brake reservoir
	- 1x Philips head screw at the back
	- 1x Push pin at the bottom
	- Watch the tabs at the top
- Upper bolt
	- Because of my Packout mount, I also need to undo the shielding first to get to the upper bolt.
	- 5mm Hex Key.
- 2x cylinder head bolts.
- The 16k service calls for cleaning the spark arrester. A *5mm Hex key* will get the outer cover off, and an *8mm socket* will release the spark arrestor from the exhaust itself.

### Loosen the rear brake lever to access the engine case bolts

*Needle nose pliers, Split pin tool, some paracord*

- Refer to the manual on 3-15 here to identify how things are assembled: the split pin is on the inside of the rear of the brake lever where it connects to the rear brake cylinder, the springs help it return to the upright position, and the c-clip helps it remain attached to the black plate.
- Undo the split pin at the back and slide it out of the shaft that connects the lever to the rear brake cylinder. Mine needed to be very straight to do that. Needle nose pliers worked here.
- Undo the C-clip holding the washer and brake lever onto the retaining shaft.
- Disconnect the springs holding the lever up (I used paracord)

### Remove the right side engine case cover

*Oil drop tray, Rubber mallet, 8mm T-handle tool from Promotion or equivalent long reach 8mm, maybe 14mm + flathead screwdriver*

- Undo all the bolts. It'll go faster with an electric screwdriver.
- Use the rubber mallet and give some persuasion to release. Some are really stuck on and needs a hefty swing to jolt the engine casing free
	- This is why you remove the exhaust; if yours comes free easily, then you don't need to remove the exhaust.
- When the engine case cracks open, oil trapped in the bottom of the engine case will leak out.
- I couldn't tell if it was connected or not so I unscrewed the semiautomatic clutch adjustment nut. I'm pretty sure it's not, but it's also a good reminder to adjust that once everything is reassembled.

### Curse life, then remove the engine case gasket

*Razor blade, bread tabs, anything you think will work, it's a fairly tight space*

- If the gasket is torn on the sides or bottom, you'll need to replace it. Apparently it can be reused if it's only the top. Mine was bone dry on the top when I removed it.
- Clean the gasket surfaces well. This took me about 45 minutes because it came off in tons of tiny pieces. Might be worth covering the internals with a plastic freezer bag just to make it easier to get the tiny bits of filter paper out later.

### Undo the three bolts holding the oil spinner cover

*8mm socket, impact driver, possibly a quarter, your cleaner of choice*
- Top stop it rotating I put a quarter into the gearing so I could undo the screws. Remember to remove the quarter after.......
- Using an 8mm socket, either with the impact driver to loosen it or doing the coin trick, loosen the 3 bolts holding the cover on (looks like a Reuleaux triangle).
- Remove the oil gasket.
- Clean it out with your method of choice.

### Clean the filter screen
*Needle nose pliers*
- Remove the filter screen from the lower portion of the engine and clean it out. It has orientation, so make sure to reinsert it in the correct orientation.
	- Tapers to a point inwards, and has a flange for the upper side.

### Reassembly of inside engine case parts
*Torque wrench, 8mm socket, needle nose pliers.*
- Filter screen in
- Tighten three bolts holding the oil spinner cover - 5 Nm, 8mm socket
	- Use a new gasket.
- If you used a quarter to hold things in place, make sure you know where the quarter is.

### Reinstall the engine case cover
- Oil up the lining of the engine cover and the gasket by running an oily finger over both. Install the engine gasket.
- Lean the bike over to about 45 degrees or more. Some people use a milk crate under the bars, but a chair works pretty well.
- Using 2-23 of the manual make sure the linkage sits on the shaft and connector. it's a two piece part and the long bit goes on the inside. Watch Quasimotard's video for reference.
- Place the spring loaded ball bearing portion on the shaft and line it up with the indents on the shift linkage. It'll fall if you jostle it too much.
- Reinstall the engine case. Any noises that aren't it sliding solidly on will probably be the spring loaded portion falling. If you remove the oil filler plug, you'll be able to look inside and see a little more easily.
- *8mm Socket @ 12 Nm* for the engine case bolts, tighten in the star pattern.
- Bring the bike upright again
- Check that the oil drain plug is closed.

### Perform semiautomatic clutch adjustment procedure
*14mm wrench + flathead screwdriver @ 12 Nm* 
- All the way to the right, all the way to the left, 1/8 turn to the right, hold in place with the flathead and tighten the locking nut.

### Check the bike can shift
- I had enough excess oil so I filled it with oil, started the bike without the exhaust connected and shifted through the gears. That way if I needed to disconnect everything and do it again, I wasn't going to have to undo a lot of stuff.
- To do this, I had to reconnect the switch and spring for the sidestand.
	- Reinstall the step bar. **12mm socket** with no torque spec. The ones with washers go on the step bar.
	- **Philips head** to reinstall the sidestand switch, 10 Nm. Apply loctite first if reusing.
	- Reinstall the spring for the sidestand (I used *paracord*)

### Reinstallation of everything

- Reconnect the brake lever C-clip and washer using the *split ring tool*
- Reconnect the brake lever to the rear brake cylinder using a new *2.0x12mm split pin*.
- Reconnect the springs that hold the brake lever up (I used *paracord*)
- Reinstall the exhaust using *12mm sockets @ 27 Nm*. 1 upper bolt under the rack, one mid bolt on the underside of the middle, and 2 at the cylinder head.  For the cylinder head, tighten one, then the other, and alternate. If loosening the exhaust cover to access the upper bolt, *5mm hex key* for those.
- Reinstall the cover over the rear brake fluid reservoir. Fist of persuasion, 1 push pin on the underside and a *Philips head* screw towards the rear.
- If not already done, reinstall the step bar.
- Reinstall the engine guards. *12mm no torque spec*.
- Reinstall the kickstart.
- Reinstall the bash plate. *5mm hex key*
