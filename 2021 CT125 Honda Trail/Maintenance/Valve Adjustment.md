## Preparation
***Spark plug puller***
1. Clean the areas around the intake valve cover and the exhaust valve cover.
2. Right side of the bike, pull the spark plug.
3. Inspect for 0.03" to 0.04" (0.8-0.9mm) gap. Take photos.

## Align crank with intake valve adjust position
***6mm hex, 10mm hex, 17mm socket***
3. Left side of bike, remove the 2 hex covers next to the shifter toe. Don't lose the O-Rings under the covers. The top left is a 6mm allen key.
4. Turn crank manually until the groove on the top right visual port aligns with the Top Dead Cener (TDC) T marker.
	1. Be aware there are two TDC markers. When turning to the right, the intake TDC is the second one.

## Inspect the intake valve
5. Using 8mm socket, remove the intake valve (top) covers carefully. Do not damage the O-ring under the cover.
6. Get the 0.004" and 0.005" feeler gauges and slide them in under the valve. Make sure it's parallel.
7. If adjustment is needed, use the valve adjustment tool to adjust the valve, but first check the TDC Maker is in the right place. [[#Adjusting the valve]]
8. Clean off the mating surfaces and reassemble the cover.

## Inspect the exhaust valve
9. Left side of the bike, move the crank to top dead center of the power stroke.
10. Get the 0.006", **0.007"** and 0.008" feeler gauges.
11. Place a catch for any errant oil under the exhaust port. A rag on the bashplate is a good idea.
12. Loosen the bolts and quickly drop the cover down to catch as much oil as possible.
13. Repeat the process used for the intake valve on the exhaust. The feeler gauge angle is awkward.
14. When reassembling the cover, quickly replace the cover and then insert the bolts so no oil is lost. The O-Ring should prevent any oil loss if you do it quickly.

## Post-adjustment
15. Check there is no errant oil.
16. The covers are just covers and don't need massive amounts of torque to close them. Tighten
	- The two bolts on the intake cover
	- The two bolts on the exhaust cover
	- Reverse turn until click, then tighten due to high TPI. Tighten to snug and not much more (1/32" turn after it's hand tight):
		- The 6mm hex bolt cover on the left side of the bike.
		- The 10mm hex bolt cover on the left side of the bike.
	- Spark Plug should be reinserted and tightened. 8-12 ft lbs, about 1/4 turn.

## Adjusting the valve
1. The Valve adjustment tool separates. 
2. If the valve is in the wrong place, slightly overrighten the valve with the feeler gauge still in between the valves using the valve adjustment tool inside part only, then reassemble the tool, back it off slightly, and then make sure the valve clearance is correct.
3. The drag force should feel like pulling a piece of paper gently and smoothly through two fingers.
4. As you tighten, it will adjust the valve slightly. Can tighten with the feeler gauge still inserted, which can give a small visual indicator as things are tightened up, and also prevent it from moving as much as you tighten.
5. Tighten everything down and check valve clearance after it's tightened. Verify the go-no go valve feeler gauges will fit and not fit. The no go should not slide in, and the go should just slide in with a tiny bit of resistance.
