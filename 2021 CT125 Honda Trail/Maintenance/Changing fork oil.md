## Procedure

### Check the fork seals
1. If you need new forks seals, you'll need additional components before you start. If the fork seals are intact you won't need to replace the seals and can proceed with just changing the oil.
	- **[SEAL SET, FR. FORK](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-51490-k88-l01-seal-set-fr-fork)** 51490-K88-L01

### (Recommended) Prepare for disassembly
1. If undoing the handlebars this will make subsequent steps easier as the handlebars do make the front end slightly more stable when working on it.
2. The reflector mount near the top of the fork boot uses a **10mm socket**. This will allow easier access to the fork boot band clamps.
3. The cover for the wheel speed ABS sensor uses 2 JIS/PH screws and can be removed using **a small JIS/PH driver**.
4. The band clamps on the fork boot can be loosened using the **small JIS/PH driver**.
5. The bolt holding the guide for the ABS sensor cable bolted to the front fork can be removed using an **8mm socket**.
6. The handlebar bolts on the upper handlebar holder use **6mm hex keys**.
7. The wheel speed ABS sensor uses a **10mm socket**.
8. The wheel axle nuts use **14mm and 19mm sockets**.
9. Covering the horizontal portion of the fender mounts with **painter's tape** will protect the paint job from damage when removing the fender.
10. Create a makeshift dipstick using the zip ties. The zip tie has a textured portion with a smooth portion towards the tip; Using the tape measure, measure off 140mm or 5.5 inches to the end of the textured portion with the smooth portion extending to the 6" mark. This will allow you to creep up on the oil mark.
11. Placing something heavy on the back of the bike or something under the bash plate will lift the front up and make it easier to work on.
12. **Heavily recommended: Securing the center stand to the bash plate** will ensure if you do accidentally tip the bike too far forward you won't have the bike fall down off the center stand.

### Remove the front wheel

1. Using a 14mm and 19mm wrench, undo the front wheel axle and remove the front wheel. Store the axle and nuts with the wheel for now.

### Remove the wheel speed sensor

1. Using a 10mm socket remove the wheel speed sensor from the fork.
- **If reusing the bolt on reinstall, apply blue threadlocker.**
	- **[BOLT, FLANGE (6X14)](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-90117-kzz-j80-bolt-flange-6x14-not-available)** 90117-KZZ-J80

### Remove the brake caliper

1. Undo the two bolts holding the brake caliper to the fork using a **12mm socket**. The caliper sits inside of the fork for reassembly.
- **Reinstallation torque spec: 30 Nm**
	- **[BOLT, FLANGE (8X25)](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-90131-kgh-900-bolt-flange-8x25)** 90131-KGH-900

### (Optional) Undo the handlebars

If the handlebars are in the forward position, you'll need to remove the handlebars before removing the fork caps.
1. Remove the 4 socket bolt caps on the handlebar holder bolts. A sharp blade to pry up the caps may help.
2. Using a 6mm hex key, remove the 4 bolts from the upper handlebar holder.

#### Reassembly note

1. There's a bolt order for those bolts - the 2 bolts to the front of the bike first, then the 2 bolts closest to the rider.

### Loosen the fork end caps and all pinch bolts

1. Using a **17mm socket**, crack the nuts on the fork end caps.
2. After that is complete, loosen the triple clap pinch bolts using a **6mm hex key**.
	- **[BOLT, FLANGE SOCKET (8X32)](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-90160-k26-900-bolt-flange-socket-8x32)** 90160-K26-900

### Remove the front fender

1. Remove the 4 inner bolts holding the front fender on to the forks.
2. **Reminder:** Save a paint job, cover the horizontal mounts with painter's tape.
3. Lower the fender down through the bottom of the forks, squeezing the struts together as you do so they will pass through the forks easily.

### Remove the fork end caps and internal components
1. **Prereq:** Make sure you have an automotive towel / paper towel ready and wear gloves. Removing the spring SLOWLY will require less cleanup. Having a clean area to place the fork components before you start is a good idea, as is wearing gloves.
2. Remove the fork end cap with the **17mm socket**.
3. Remove the three internal components from the fork using the **magnetic pickup tool**. The spring is last, remove that one slowly as it will be coated in oil and will drip it everywhere if you move too quickly. Lay them down in the prepared clean area.

### Remove the fork from the triple clamp
1. Slide the fork down and out through the bottom of the triple clamp.

#### Reassembly note
1. There are some rubber covers that sit below below the triple clamp near the fork cap. On reinstallation, these rubber covers didn't always line up perfectly and could easily bunch up and get damaged. Pay extra special attention on the reinstallation step as you line up the headlight bracket, the tripleclamps and the forks on reinstallation

### Replacing the fork oil
1. **Prereq:** Having the fork oil bottle cap off, plus your measuring tool close by will make this easier. Accept that you will also probably have to pour some back into the container. Have the measuring tape close by to verify the dipstick tool didn't move while filling the fork.
2. Removing the boot is optional but makes things slightly easier.
3. With the fork out, tip it upside down and pump the fork a few times to remove all the excess oil.
4. Once all the oil has been ejected, this is a good opportunity to really clean everything well while it's all disassembled.
5. When ready to reassemble, get two paper towels ready to soak up excess oil and hold the fork with the **paper towels**. Have your **measuring dipstick** close by.
6. Measure out or eyeball ~**4.1 fl oz of 10W fork oil**. 
7. Compress the forks fully. Add in the oil, and measure it with the dipstick to know you have **140mm / 5.5" of oil in the fork from the top of the fork tube**.
	- **Very important:** Use the dipstick to make sure that you do not overfill the oil. If you overfill the oil, pour some back into your container, or use a suction kit to remove excess.
	- When you have the right amount of oil in the fork, measure your dipstick tool again to make sure it's still accurate and you didn't accidentally overfill
8. Repeat this process with the other fork.
	- **Manual ref**: 3-23 Fork. [[CT125 Manual References/Trail-125A-Service-Manual.pdf#page=93|Link]]

### Reassembly
1. **Prereq:** Have the fork end cap, the **17mm socket** on the **torque wrench** set to **22 Nm**, and the **6mm hex key** handy.
	1. **Clean everything thoroughly.** If you used WD40 to remove the forks, this is a good opportunity to remove any excess.
2. If you removed the fork boot, at this point put it back over the fork for reassembly.
3. Reinsert the fork back into the triple clamp. Note the rubber covers near the top triple clamp (where the fork cap normally sits) on reinsertion are prone to damage. Line everything up nicely as you go and once the fork tube is all the way through the upper clamp and sitting slightly prone, tighten the fork cap all the way but finger tight to stop it falling out the bottom of the clamps once you let go of the fork. 
4. Reinsert the second fork back into the triple clamp using the same process.
5. Lifting the fork up slightly and shimming the gap between the fork end cap and the triple clamp with a business card, using a **6mm hex key** partially tighten the pinch bolts on the triple clamp to hold everything in place as you torque the top, then remove the shim.
	- This will prevent the forks twisting and doing damage to the fork boot, but you'll still be tightening the fork end cap against the fork, not the triple clamp.
6. Remove the fork cap and place the spring in, the fork spring joint and the spring collar before reinstalling the fork cap to **22 Nm** using a **17mm socket**. 
7. Repeat for the other side.
8. Using the **6mm hex key** loosen the triple clamp pinch bolts and make sure the fork cap is flush with the top of the triple clamp before tightening to **29 Nm**.
9. If you removed the handlebars to access the forks, reinstall the handlebars using the **6mm hex key** to **27 Nm**. 
	- Note the previously mentioned tightening pattern of the **two bolts at the front first**, then **two bolts closest to the rider second**.
10. Reinstall 4 bolts holding the fender using the **10mm socket**.
11. Reinstall the brake caliper using the **12mm socket** set to **30 Nm**.
	- Use either new bolts or apply blue thread locker to the bolts.
12. Reinstall the wheel speed ABS guide wire guide using the **8mm socket**.
13. Reinstall the wheel speed ABS sensor using the **10mm socket**.
	- Use either a new bolt or apply thread locker to the bolt
14. Reinstall the wheel speed ABS cover using the **JIS/PH driver**.
15. Tighten the band clamps holding the fork boot on. For the lower one, the fork boot needs to sit in the groove of the suspension. The upper should be pushed up as far as is possible and tightened using the **JIS/PH driver**. There is a spec on the alignment and position of the band clamps holding the fork boot on, but the most important things are:
	1. The drainage/ventilation holes in the fork boots are facing backwards.
	2. The band clamps do not have anything poking out that could snag on anything when you move the handlebars, etc.
16. Reinstall the front wheel. I've had more success coming in directly from the front instead of from below. You'll likely need to spread the forks slightly to accommodate the spacers.
17. Reinstall the reflectors removed to access the band clamps.
18. If you tied the center stand to the bash plate, you can remove that now.
