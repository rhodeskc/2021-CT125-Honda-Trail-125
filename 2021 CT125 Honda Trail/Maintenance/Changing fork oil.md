## Procedure

### Make a measuring tool
1. Using two zip ties or some equivalent, make a measuring tool that will measure out 140mm of liquid or 5.5 inches. See [[MakeshiftDepthGuide.jpg]].

### Check the seals are still intact
1. Just in case this job might be bigger than expected, inspect the seals first. Loosen the band clamp holding the fork boot on the lower portion of the suspension.

### Loosen all high torque (above 20 ft lb) bolts while the bike is still together
1. Loosen the 6mm hex triple clamp bolts
2. Loosen the flange bolt holding the brake caliper on the bike using the 12mm socket.
3. Undo the Philips head screws holding the ABS wheel sensor cover on.
4. Remove the two reflectors left and right using the 8mm socket and set aside.
5. Loosen the bolt guiding the ABS wire down the fork using the 8mm socket
6. Loosen the 14mm and 19mm axle nuts holding the front wheel on.

### Optional: Undo handlebars
If the handlebars are in the forward position, you'll need to remove the handlebars before removing the fork caps to do this job.
1. Mark on the bars the rotational angle. Either use a marker or some painter's tape.
2. Remove the 4 socket bolt caps on the handlebar holder bolts. A sharp blade to pry up the caps may help.
3. Using a 6mm hex key, remove the 4 bolts from the upper handlebar holder.

### Optional safety measures
1. Weigh down the back of the bike with at least 40 lbs of gear to lift the front of the bike up. Don't use water it'll splash everywhere.
2. Tie the center stand to the bash plate so that if the bike does tilt forward as you're working on it, it won't fall off the center stand.

### Remove the front wheel
1. Use a 14mm and 19mm socket to remove the front wheel. Once the axle is out, store it with the wheel.

### Disconnect the brake caliper and ABS sensor
1. Remove the ABS wheel speed sensor cover using the Philip / JIS driver
2. Remove the ABS wheel speed sensor using the 8mm socket.
3. Unscrew the brake calipers using the 12mm socket.
4. Follow the ABS wire up and unscrew the guide, 10mm socket.

### Unbolt the fender
1. Unscrew the 4 inner hex bolts holding the fender on using the 10mm socket.
2. This will have to slide out through the bottom of the forks.
3. **Recommendation:** Use painter's tape on the strut portions of the fender before sliding it down and out to protect the paint job.

### Remove the fork inner components
1. Using a 17mm socket, remove the fork cap.
2. There are three inner components to the fork that will fall out if it's tipped upside down
	- [COLLAR, SPRING](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-51402-kgh-901-collar-spring)  - 51402-KGH-901 (basically a pipe)
	- [JOINT, FR. FORK SPRING](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-51403-gf4-003-joint-fr-fork-spring)  - 51403-GF4-003 (basically a washer)
	- [SPRING, FR. FORK (SHOWA)](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-51401-k2e-t01-spring-fr-fork-showa) - 51401-K2E-T01 (a dual rate spring with the tighter coils at the bottom)
3. Make sure you have some automotive towels handy for the next step.
4. Using a **magnetic pickup**, retrieve the three components and lay them out on some cardboard.
5. As you remove the spring, be extra careful as a lot of oil can potentially come out with it. Slow and smooth.
6. Once those three are out the fork can be removed.

### Remove the fork
1. Undo and/or remove the flange bolts holding the tripleclamps, upper and lower, using a 6mm hex key.
2. Try to remove the fork by hand. It should slide out. If it doesn't, try to twist it in its housing, and if that still doesn't work try some penetrating oil.

### Clean everything
1. This is a good opportunity to clean everything of WD40, dirt, etc. before putting everything back together again.

### Changing the oil
1. Drain the oil out of the fork into the waste receptacle. Be sure to pump the suspension a few times to get as much of the old oil out as is possible.
2. Taking a rag to catch overflow and wipe off the measuring tool, use the tool like the dipstick for engine oil to measure how much oil to add to the fork. Creep up on it & note that it takes very little to go over the mark. It should be about 4.1 fl oz, **to a depth of 5.5 inches** or 140mm

### Reassemble the fork
1. Note: There's a rubber grommet near the top of the forks that has a tendency to get smooshed if not carefully aligned.
	- [MOUNT, FORK COVER (UPPER)](https://www.revzilla.com/oem/honda/honda-51621-k2e-t00-mount-fork-cover-upper) - 51621-K2E-T00
2. With the hex driver and fork cap close by, reinsert the forks back into the headlight brackets and triple clamps. Be extra careful of the fork mount covers.
3. Tighten the fork cap all the closed it won't fall out the bottom of the forks if you let it go.
4. Placing a business card shim underneath the fork cap, rest the fork cap on the top of the triple clamp and tighten the pinch bolts on the triple clamp using the **6mm hex key**. Once the business card shim is removed, the fork cap should sit flush with the top of the triple clamp.
5. Remove the fork cap from the top of the triple clamp.
6. Drop the fork spring into the fork with the tighter windings facing down.
7. Drop the fork spring joint into the fork and tap it a few times with the collar to make sure it sits flush with the top of the spring.
8. Drop in the fork collar.
9. Reinstall the fork cap.
10. Repeat for both forks.

### Reassembly of the bike
1. (Optional) Torque the handlebar hex bolts to **27 Nm** using the **6mm hex key**.
2. 3. Reinstall the fender using the **10mm socket**
4. Reinstall the wheel speed (ABS) sensor using the **8mm socket** and **blue threadlocker**. 
5. Reinstall the brake caliper using the **12mm socket** to **30 Nm**. If reusing the bolts, **apply blue threadlocker**.
6. Reinstall the front wheel using the **14mm and 19mm sockets**. I've found it goes together easier if I come in from the front instead of from below.
7. Reinstall the guide to the wheel speed sensor using the **10mm socket**.
8. Reinstall the wheel speed (ABS) sensor cover using the **JIS driver**.
9. Make sure the fork boot is correctly oriented and the screws press as high as they can on the fork using the **JIS driver**. Correct orientation is drainage holes on the boots face backwards.
