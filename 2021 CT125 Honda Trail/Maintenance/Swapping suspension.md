# Right side
1. [[Removing Exhaust|Remove the exhaust]]
2. Unbolt rear suspension upper bolt adapter. Use a 19mm spanner. BOLT, ADAPTER (8MM) P/N 90165-K2E-T00
3. Unbolt the rear suspension lower bolt. Use a 14mm socket. NUT, FLANGE CAP (10MM) P/N 90201-HA0-000

# Swapping in the new exhaust
1. Remove one suspension at a time. I was using the Treatland suspension, which comes with bushings that are too small for the upper bolt. Push out the old suspension's bushings and push it into the new suspension.
2. Loosen the lockring at the bottom. In the case of the Treatland suspension, this will require a lockring tool.
3. Fit the upper to the edge of the suspension mount point on the upper. Spin the lower until it reaches the appropriate length to easily slide over the end of the lower mount.
4. Tighten the lockring against the bottom.
